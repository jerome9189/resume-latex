\section*{\color{crimson}{Relevant Experience}}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
    \item \work{Stealth Startup}{Data Science Intern}{Seattle, WA}{January 2019-March 2019}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Applied machine learning techniques on clients' internal communication datasets to identify avenues for improving workplace productivity
        \item Worked with nearly 1 million text records from a SQL database. Handled querying and dataframe manipulation with vectorized code
        \item Bootstrapped labels for unlabeled data using topic models and other heuristic techniques
        \item Trained a Bidirectional LSTM model for binary classification using heuristically labeled data to achieve an accuracy of 83\% (approximately 12\% higher than the baseline result)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \work{University of Washington}{Research Assistant}{Seattle, WA}{March 2018-June 2018}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Revamped a web service that visualizes data from solar panels deployed around the University
        \item Augmented the flexibility of the user interface by increasing the number of options available to users
        \item Used React.js and software tools to enhance the UI and SQL to query data
    \end{itemize}
    \item \work{Elcano Project, UW Bothell}{Research Assistant}{Bothell, WA}{March 2018-June 2018}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented physical braking systems for self-driving trikes
        \item Prototyped an algorithm for obstacle avoidance that responds to sensor inputs and prevents collision; implemented a simplified version of the algorithm in C++
    \end{itemize}
